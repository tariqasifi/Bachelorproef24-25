abstract = {Due to the large number of IoT devices available, data needed to be processed by cloud service providers has grown exponentially. This leads to increase in the latency of cloud services and by extension latency in many IoT applications. To reduce this latency, computing devices are installed at the edge of the network close to the user. These devices are called “Fog Nodes”. They allow the user to process some data without going all the way to the data center. While the data centers are equipped with abundant resources (i.e. processors, energy and memory), the fog devices are not. This means traditional techniques for preventing intrusion are not applicable at the fog level, because they will incur more latency and/or energy consumption. Therefore, there is a need for low resource demanding, yet strong security system that will protect the fog layer from being attacked. This paper proposes an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) for Man in the Middle (MitM) attack at the fog layer. The IDS consists of IDS nodes that periodically interrogate nodes one hop away. The IPS uses lightweight encryption to prevent Man in the Middle attack and its variants (i.e. Eavesdropping, Packet Modification and Wormhole attack).}

abstract = {Fifth generation communication networks (5G) has received a great deal of attention from academia and industry alike, which will enable a wide variety of vertical applications by connecting heterogeneous devices and machines. Assessing availability and reliability in many circumstances and environments is critical. Researchers have recently focused on investigating and analyzing new multimedia networks with artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to achieve higher data rates and secure communication traffic between parties. User information privacy and security are of vital importance and of growing concerns that present evolving challenges to overcome in preventing attacks. Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack is considered one of the most common attacks, where an attacker can impersonate one of the parties in a communication system to steal user data or forge the malicious data. Due to the limitation of using conventional cryptographic techniques for mobile networks and similar systems, new methods have been introduced to validate and authenticate transmitted signals dynamically, depending on the physical layer. In this paper, we present the distance-time directional delay (DTDD) model to detect the MITM attack in a variety of contexts and scenario. Indoor hotspots (InH) and urban micro-cellular (UMi) propagation environments were investigated to verify the reliability of the proposed approaches using realistic 5G millimeter-wave configurations and system setups. Simulations have been constructed based on the mmWave 5G channel simulator tool NYUSIM, in conjunction with a collection of machine learning algorithms (ML) including the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) as the core of the presented models and methodologies. Numerical simulations results produced a detection accuracy approaching 100% in the InH environment scenario, whereas for UMi environment scenario, a detection accuracy approaching 99% was attained.}

abstract = {Security is the primary concern in any IoT application or network. Due to the rapid increase in the usage of IoT devices, data privacy becomes one of the most challenging issue to the researcher. In IoT applications, such as health care, smart homes or any wearables, transmission of human's personal data is more frequent. Man-in-the-Middle attack is one in which outsiders eavesdrops the communication between two trusted parties and steal the important information such as password, personal identification number, etc., and misuse it. So, this paper proposes a Regression Modelling technique to detect and mitigate the attack to provide attack-free path from source to destination in an IoT network. Three machine learning techniques Linear Regression (LR), Multi-variate Linear Regression (MLR) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) used and performance of these three algorithms analyzed on various metrics and shown Gaussian Process Regression provide higher rate for detecting the attacks and produces the lower rate for misclassification of attacks.}

abstract = {The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has introduced significant cybersecurity challenges, particularly at the network edge where IoT devices operate. Traditional security policies designed for static environments fall short of addressing the dynamic, heterogeneous, and resource-constrained nature of IoT ecosystems. Existing dynamic security policy models lack versatility and fail to fully integrate comprehensive risk assessments, regulatory compliance, and AI/ML (artificial intelligence/machine learning)-driven adaptability. We develop a novel adaptive edge security framework that dynamically generates and adjusts security policies for IoT edge devices. Our framework integrates a dynamic security policy generator, a conflict detection and resolution in policy generator, a bias-aware risk assessment system, a regulatory compliance analysis system, and an AI-driven adaptability integration system. This approach produces tailored security policies that adapt to changes in the threat landscape, regulatory requirements, and device statuses. Our study identifies critical security challenges in diverse IoT environments and demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework through simulations and real-world scenarios. We found that our framework significantly enhances the adaptability and resilience of IoT security policies. Our results demonstrate the potential of AI/ML integration in creating responsive and robust security measures for IoT ecosystems. The implications of our findings suggest that dynamic and adaptive security frameworks are essential for protecting IoT devices against evolving cyber threats, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards, and maintaining the integrity and availability of IoT services across various applications.}

abstract = {Multi-Channel Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks are special MitM attacks capable of manipulating encrypted wireless frames between two legitimate endpoints. Since its inception in 2014, attackers have been targeting Wi-Fi networks to perform different attacks, such as cipher downgrades, denial of service, key reinstallation attacks (KRACK) in 2017, and recently FragAttacks in 2021, which widely impacted millions of Wi-Fi devices, especially IoT devices. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies in the literature that holistically review the different types of Multi-Channel MitM enabled attacks and analyze their potential impact. To this end, we evaluate the capabilities of Multi-Channel MitM and review every reported attack in the state of the art. We examine practical issues that hamper the total adoption of protection mechanisms, i.e., security patches and Protected Management Frames (PMF), and review available defense mechanisms in confronting the Multi-Channel MitM enabled attacks in the IoT context. Finally, we highlight the potential research problems and identify future research approaches in this field.}
